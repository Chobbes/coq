Presentation of the Addendum
============================

Here you will find several pieces of additional documentation for
theCoq Reference Manual. Each of this chapters is concentrated on a
particular topic, that should interest only a fraction of the Coq
users: that’s the reason why they are apart from the Reference Manual.

:Extended pattern-matching: This chapter details the use of
  generalized pattern-matching. It is contributed by Cristina Cornes and
  Hugo Herbelin.
:Implicit coercions: This chapter details the use of the coercion
  mechanism. It is contributed by Amokrane Saïbi.
:Program extraction: This chapter explains how to extract in practice
  ML files from F ω terms. It is contributed by Jean-Christophe
  Filliâtre and Pierre Letouzey.
:Program: This chapter explains the use of the Program vernacular
  which allows the development of certified programs in Coq. It is
  contributed by Matthieu Sozeau and replaces the previous Program
  tactic by Catherine Parent.
:omega: omega, written by Pierre Crégut, solves a whole class of
  arithmetic problems.
:The ring tactic: This is a tactic to do AC rewriting. This chapter
  explains how to use it and how it works. The chapter is contributed by
  Patrick Loiseleur.
:The Setoid_replace tactic: This is a tactic to do rewriting on types
  equipped with specific (only partially substitutive) equality. The
  chapter is contributed by Clément Renard.
:Calling external provers: This chapter describes several tactics
  which call external provers.
